/**
 *  Publishes to a BodyPosition component so that server-side systems
 *  have easy access to the mobile entity positions.  Since we wrote
 *  our own simple physics engine for this example, we could have just
 *  added BodyPosition as a field to the Body class but I wanted to show
 *  how one might integrate this component using a physics system that
 *  wouldn't let you do that.
 *
 *  Note: also adding the BodyPosition to the entity on the server
 *  is what makes it available on the client so that it can have a place
 *  to add its object update events from the network.  The BodyPosition
 *  component itself is actually transferred empty.
