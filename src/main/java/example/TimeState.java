/**
 *  Provides a consistent frame time to the classes that want it.
 *  Time inevitably marches forward except in the case of this state.
 *  When update() is called, the frame time is locked such that getTime()
 *  will return the same value until after the next update().  This makes
 *  sure that small inter-frame time differences don't creep into interpolated
 *  visuals.
 *
 *  For a simple game example like this, it isn't really necessary but it's
 *  a good pattern to follow.
