     *  <p>The first parameter defines how many bits are used to encode zone IDs.  
     *  Zones are always defined relative to the player so this will be a function of
     *  the zone radius.  For example, a radius of (1, 1, 1) means a 3D grid that's
     *  3x3x3 or 27 different zones.  At least 5 bits would be necessary to encode
     *  those IDs.  I use 8 here arbitrarily to give some space for zone radius
     *  experimentation.  8 bits should support a zone radius up to (3, 3, 2).</p>
     *
     *  <p>The second parameter is how many bits are associated with the real
     *  object IDs.  These IDs are not sent with every message so it's important that
     *  the value properly encompass all potential IDs.  For example, using a long ID
     *  from an ES you would need 64 bits.  If game sessions are short lived and your
     *  object IDs are only ever 'int' then 32 bits is the proper value.  This should
     *  usually be 64 bits and I'm keeping it as such... even though this example
     *  could get away with 32 bits.  Since these values are not sent with every message
     *  and people might cut/paste these settings, I'm going with the safer choice.</p>
